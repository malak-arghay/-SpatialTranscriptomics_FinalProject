# FINAL DEGREE PROJECT : Mapping Y chromosome Activity across the Tumor Landscape in Bladder Cancer patients: a Spatial Transcriptomics Approach 

Welcome to the repository for my final degree project in Spatial Transcriptomics. This study maps mosaic loss of the Y chromosome (LOY) in 33 muscle-invasive bladder cancer samples from the DUTRENEO trial using Visium spatial transcriptomics. We designed a 43-gene ChrY expression signature and computed raw RNA countâ€“based Y_sum per spot. By integrating these data with inferred clonal lineages and consensus molecular subtypes, we show that LOY is heterogeneous , not random , forming clusters at invasive fronts and within specific clones, especially Basal-Squamous and Stroma-Rich subtypes, and might correlate with chemoresistance. These insights establish LOY as a spatially and clonally driven modifier of tumor evolution and treatment response.
